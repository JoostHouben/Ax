    "\n",
    "`GenerationStrategy` ([API reference](https://ax.dev/api/modelbridge.html#ax.modelbridge.generation_strategy.GenerationStrategy)) is a key abstraction in Ax:\n",
    "- It allows for specifying multiple optimization algorithms to chain one after another in the course of the optimization. \n",
    "- Many higher-level APIs in Ax use generation strategies: Service and Loop APIs, `Scheduler` etc. (tutorials for all those higher-level APIs are here: https://ax.dev/tutorials/).\n",
    "- Generation strategy allows for storage and resumption of modeling setups, making optimization resumable from SQL or JSON snapshots.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through a few examples of generation strategies and discusses its important settings. Before reading it, we recommend familiarizing yourself with how `Model` and `ModelBridge` work in Ax: https://ax.dev/docs/models.html#deeper-dive-organization-of-the-modeling-stack.\n",

    "Below is a list of important \"gotchas\" of using generation strategy (especially outside of the higher-level APIs like the Service API or the `Scheduler`):\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3A. `GenerationStrategy.gen` produces `GeneratorRun`-s, not trials\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `GenerationStrategy.gen` mimics `ModelBridge.gen` and allows for human-in-the-loop usage mode, a call to `gen` produces a `GeneratorRun`, which can then be added (or altered before addition or not added at all) to a `Trial` or `BatchTrial` on a given experiment. So it's important to add the generator run to a trial, since otherwise it will not be attached to the experiment on its own."

Since the capturing logic is part of `Models.__call__` function, it is not present in a factory function. Furthermore, there is no safe and flexible way to serialize callables in Python.\n",
    "2. **Standardization:** While a 'factory function' is by default more flexible (accepts any specified inputs and produces a `ModelBridge` with an underlying `Model` instance based on them), it is not standard in terms of its inputs. `Models` introduces a standardized interface, making it easy to adapt any example to one's specific case."
